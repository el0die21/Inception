#  Inception

The project **Inception** in an introductory project designed to familiarize students with containerization using Docker. 

It involves setting up a complete Docker environment for a multi-service application, including Nginx, WordPress and MariaDB.

The goal is to gain hands-on experience with **Docker's core features**, including container creation, image management and networking.

Students are required to create their own **Dockerfiles** for each service and develop a custom **Docker Compose file** to orchestrate and manage the entire setup. 

## Features
1. **Set up a Docker environment:** Create a Dockerized environment to run applications and services
2. **Deploy Nginx:** Configure Ngninx as a web server to handle HTTP requests and serve static content
3. **Install WordPress:** Set up a WordPress instance for content management, ensuring it runs smoothly within the Docker environment
4. **Configure MariaDB:** Install and configure MariaDB as the database server to store WordPress data, ensuring proper connectivity between WordPress and MariaDB

The project involves integrating these components to work together within Docker containers, managing networking, volumes and service dependencies to create a 
fully functional and scalable application stack.

<u>Objectives<u>
1. Gain hands-on experience with Docker and containerization
2. Learn to integrate and manage multiple services in a Docker environment
3. Develop skills in configuring web servers, databases and content management systems
